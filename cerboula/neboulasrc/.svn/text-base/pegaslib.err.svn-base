           for the species file:
PGERR 021. The molar mass is zero, which will induce a specific gas
           constant of zero as well, in the species file:
PGERR 022. There was an error during a READ of the species file.
           Check that the syntax of this file is correct: 
PGERR 023. There was an error during a READ of the reference table
           file. Check that the syntax of this file is correct:

           not be performed.
PGERR 030. The value of temperature is too low compared to the range
           of reference tables.
PGERR 031. The value of temperature is too high compared to the range
           of reference tables.
PGERR 032. The value of specific gas constant of the mixture is zero
           or lower:

           the mixture is zero or lower:
PGERR 035. The value of the molar mass of one species is zero
           or lower:

           Corresponding property will not be correct. Filename:
PGERR 038. There was an error trying to open an existing data file for
           Gupta fits. Maybe the file that follows is already in use:
PGWAR 039. Pressure is out of range for the use of Gupta curve fits.
           Computed properties will be irrelevant.
